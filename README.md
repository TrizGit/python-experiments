# Python Experiments
These are my python files i made. Because why wouldn't i have a little bit of experiment?  
**(some are made for [_my course_](https://algorithmicschool.com) or by _ai_, see the folders.)**

## Testing
If you want to test it yourself[^1], download the file that you want.  
**(There's should be a download file button somewhere.)**

[^1]: I recommend using [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) and/or pygame 2.6.1, since those are the version i'm using.
